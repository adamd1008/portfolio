surf

====

This is a set of Python classes designed to make surfing easy! Surfing as in surfing on Counter-Strike and other Valve GoldSrc/Source games.

It uses the SQLite database stored in surf.db. This will contain your choice of surf servers and maps along with their tier and your personal ratings of them.

A little knowledge of Python will go a long way but hopefully you wont need any. Just remember that if you get stuck and want to get back to the ">>>" prompt, press ctrl+c.
