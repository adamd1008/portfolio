log

####

This library offers an easy-to-use way of outputting debugging and other information to a log file. Time since initialisation is automatically printed with each message, in much the same way as Linux logs in /var/log.

Sample output:

* When initialised with LOG_FLAG_SRC_INFO:

[   19.298347] <admin_socket.c:193> INFO: Connection from host 127.0.0.1

* Without:

[    6.862573] INFO: Received EOF

Updated 07/10/14 (v1.0.1)

* logPrint() is now a variadic function which takes a format string and variables to print in the same fashion as printf()
* `Instances' of the logging library are now based around handles, which gives the choice of using several handles in one multi-threaded application, i.e. one for each thread, or initialising it in multi-threaded mode and supplying calls to logPrint() with a `thread ID'
* Added more logging levels and allowed them to be filtered at the handle level

(See log.h for more details!)
